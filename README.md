# GTRoulette
Uses the selenium library to scrape data from a dynamic and live website. Also uses matplotlib for data analysis.
It's a personal project dedicated to finding patterns from the scraped data for profit.
Data.py shows the algorithm that yields an average of about 54% profit, which means roughly 4% correct predicted results.

I'm deciding to pause this project for a bit since I've come to the conclusion that I'll need to utilize machine learning or AI to train the data to get higher than 54%.
